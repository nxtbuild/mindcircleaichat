Baaki logon ko jinko nahi pata, TCS ne bahut saare logon ko layoff kiya aur unse poocha reason, ki woh utne trained nahi the. Ab aap agar bare minimum 3 lakh ka package de rahe ho. Aaj tak aapka package, mere time se aaj tak aapka package wahi 3.2 tak ka hai. Toh 3.2 mein aapko wahi quality wale audience, wahi log milne waale hain. Toh ab aap uske andar keh rahe hain ki kis tarah se kaam ho, toh aise toh kaise hi chalega. Aapko bhi aap apne baahar bhi raise kariye. Sirf jaake college mein woh aptitude test aur woh do C waale program, woh poochoge toh yahi milega. Aap bhi upgraded question poochiye. Packages high offer kariye toh aapko bhi accha talent milega. Seedhi si baat hai. But TCS na volume based game khelne mein vishwas rakhta hai sirf ki bahut saare log aa jaaye. Skill vagera kuch ho nahi ho, thoda bahut hum sikha denge. That's it.

Pehle hum apni app leke aayenge aur uske baad baat karenge ki Exo kaise interesting raha, kaise raha. Cohort 1 success stories podcast? Yaar woh actually mein mereko kaafi boring kaam lagta hai kyunki success stories hai toh, sir yeh obvious si baat hai, dekhiye aap log padhayenge toh success stories toh hongi hi hongi, kuch log toh successful ho hi jaate hain. Unke saath baat karne mein kaafi perspective bhi milta hai, main maanta hoon acchi cheezein hai, lekin kaafi time consuming task hai aur kaafi zyada energy lagti hai uske andar. Toh I am very sure of the stories, wahan pe acchi hogi but abhi as such koi plan nahi hai mera unke saath podcast ya kuch bhi karne ka. Maybe in future.

      "Arre bhai, jitne log... ek cheez toh maine dekhi hai, Piyush. Humein lagta hai, wahi baat hai na, jab bacche hote hain, student hote hain, lagta hai teacher ko kya hi aata hai. Jab phir us age mein pahunchte hain, yaar us teacher ko bahut kuch aata tha. Yeh logon ki galatfehmiyan na eventually door hoti hai. Bahut saare logon ko lagta hai, yaar yeh hamara CTO ban ke baith gaya ya hamara CEO ban ke baith gaya, isko kuch hi nahi aata hai. Aisa nahi hai, woh wahan pe pahuncha hai na, usne bahut kuch ukhaada hai jeevan mein, isliye woh wahan pe pahuncha hai. Logon ko maine yeh tak kehte suna hai ki Vercel ka toh CEO hai, woh karta bhi hai kya kuch hi? Mostly talk and... kabhi jaake dekho uski profile, pairon se zameen niklegi. Not only just Socket, he has written so much. Woh kabhi kabhar tweet karta hai ki mera yeh project tha, ab iska product ban gaya hai. Matlab crazy level. One of the people jinko main bolta hoon ki Twitter pe recommend karo, one is Jarred, founder of Bun. Crazy in-depth, usko shayad system ka jitna in-depth hai na, nobody... matlab uske jo normal tweets hote hain, they are full of advices. Uski ek advice ne Prisma ki direction change kar di. Prisma removed Rust just on his advice and they are doing good now. Aur ek hai Vercel ka CEO. Worth following them. They are really, really good. Toh haan ji. Ab inko kya hi advice dein? Mann bhar gaya. Dekho agar aapka mann bhar gaya hai, toh aap product bana lo. Aur agar aapka jeevan accha chal raha hai na, toh aap ek B2C SaaS bana lo. Phir uske baad toh jeevan mein kalesh hi kalesh hai. B2B SaaS mein itne nahi hain. B2C SaaS mein bahut kalesh hai. Uske baad maza bhi bahut aayega. Paisa pata nahi kitna kama paoge, nahi kama paoge.

      "Sir, Python Chai Code 3 when will you launch? Yaar abhi JS mein kar lete hain. JS ka first batch. Technically, first nahi bol sakte hum kisi bhi batch ko. But let's just say ki what, ki yeh hamara GenAI JS ka toh first hi batch hai. Toh dekhte hain. Humesha aisi queries aati hai na sir, Python ke time pe JavaScript ki queries aur JavaScript ke time mein Python ki queries. Matlab hamare liye it's not very difficult. In case aap bhi dekhoge toh moving from JS to Python, Python to JS, it's just syntax. Foundation wahi hai yaar, itna zyada kuch changes nahi aata. Foundation toh wahi rehte hain. Aur libraries ki acchi baat yeh hai ki they are supporting it like going extended mile into both languages. JavaScript walon ke saath fayda yeh hai ki tum logon ko na Vercel bhi support karta hai. Vercel ke jo AI SDK hai na, they are a charm actually. Matlab bill zyada lete hain. No doubt. Mereko JavaScript sir, matlab mujhe accha lagta hai. The reason is, number one, async support out... jo main, out of the box hai. Pata nahi, samajh humein acche se aati hai. That is the thing. Matlab aap toh sir Python ke saath work karte hue bhi, it's been 8 to 9 months. But still, I love JavaScript in that. And sir, JavaScript ki queue system, distribution aur inki API infrastructure kaafi accha hai. Toh woh cheez hai. Toh that is the thing I love. But haan, Python ke apne sir, matlab jahan pe kahin file parsing vagera karni pade, wahan pe Python really shines. And I think agar ek developer hai na sir aaj ke time mein, if we talk about today, you are, and you are on backend, you should know JavaScript and Python because hai, woh dono hi chahiye actually. ",
      "Ek do cheezein main hamesha recommend karta hoon ismein, ki at least ek complete authentication system from scratch, jismein reset password, validation, yeh woh sab, at least aapne teen se chaar baar banaya hua hona chahiye. Delete it, recreate it. Delete it, recreate it. Woh thoda ajeeb lagega aapko ki yaar, yeh bhi koi cheez hai? But it actually works. Aur at least ek full stack project aapne do baar banaya hua hona chahiye, minimum two times. Same project, not new project. Same project aapne do baar banaya, then you will get the details of it. Agar yeh kar loge, toh phir aapki shikayatein door ho jaati hai. Tha... wahi hai na, itna patience kiske paas hai ki sir, yeh project ban toh gaya hai na, ab kuch aur banaunga, ab yeh nahi banaunga. Woh banaya hua project agar dobara bana liya na, toh I don't think so uske baad tumhein meri bhi zaroorat hai ya kisi bhi tutorial ki zaroorat hai. That's true sir. Main bhi jab coding seekh raha tha na, matlab I learned mainly ki main apne seniors ka code rewrite karta tha. Ki jo mere seniors ne likha, after the office hours, main usko rewrite karke dekhunga. Toh ek habit ban jaati hai. Simple hai, hands-on ke bina nahi ho payega. Jitna marzi you... woh DHH ki, DHH ki line ekdam sahi hai woh. You learn from your fingers? Yes. Coding, music, whatever it is, maths, you learn from your fingers. Nice. ",
      "As a frontend dev, should I take the GenAI JS or Python? Dekho, agar JavaScript likhte ho na... Dekho, mera yeh goal kehne ka ki aapko ek to-do app basic banayi hui honi chahiye ya phir aapka ek frontend, yeh hai JavaScript ke saath experience, uska context samajhna zaroori hai. Uska context yeh hai ki aapko JavaScript mein hands-on experience hai kya? Dekho, ek hota hai ki sir maine videos dekhe hain. Toh woh experience nahi hai ki maine videos dekhe hain. Ek hai ki sir, maine aapke saath-saath kuch build kiya hai, either on frontend, either on backend, or any one of them. But haan, mujhe dar nahi lagta. Agar aap mujhe kahoge ki is value ko utha ke us file mein le aao, is value ko utha ke is file mein le aao ya utha ke isko kisi DB mein rakh do, DB se wapas le aao. Yeh sab cheezein agar aapko flow samajh mein aata hai na in general, then you are ideal candidate for this. Agar aap maan lo abhi first year mein aaye ho, thoda DSA ki problem solve karte ho, thoda bahut JavaScript aata hai, toh nahi hai. Toh yeh course aapke liye nahi hai. Kyunki abhi aapne sirf LeetCode ki problems dekhi hai thodi si. Aapne thoda sa JavaScript... kyunki uske baad kya hoga, hamare first batch ki tarah, haan, yeh bilkul soch ke mat aana ki aapko ek project file denge. Is project ko aap apne HOD ko de doge. HOD aapki peeth thap-thapayega, Waah beta, tum toh AI ke bahut bade dhurandhar nikle. Ab main tumhein degree aise laake ghar... Aisa mat karna. Us cheez ke liye cohort nahi hai. This is mainly for people jo ab next step pe jaana chahte hain ki theek hai yaar, woh basic to-do ho gaya apna. Frontend pe aap jo kehte ho React, iska, idhar ka, flexible vagera, mobile, woh sab main kar leta hoon ab. Ab batao, next update kya ho sakta hai life mein? Modern ke, modern tech ke hisaab se. Toh unke liye yeh perfect course hai. Toh agar aap apne aap ko koi sa bhi dev bolte ho na, frontend dev, full-stack dev, backend, if you call yourself as a dev, then it is for you. Agar you call yourself as a learner, beginner, fresher, jisko easy way mein, toh phir nahi hai. Aapka bhi time kharab hoga, hamara bhi hoga. ",
      "Haan, main abhi soch bhi raha tha Piyush, ki web jo second cohort hai, I think ek mailing list hum open kar sakte hain. Yes, request toh hai sir, kaafi saari. Toh main soch raha tha ki ek mailing list open kar dein. But wahi main soch raha tha, should we do just like a plain mailing list? Kyunki uska toh koi sense hai nahi. There are no serious people. Koi bhi email drop karke chala jaayega, you don't know about that. Maybe if we can open up like a small ticket price or something. Ki if you are really serious about it, token money, kuch ₹60 ya kuch, isse chota-mota, zyada nahi. Toh maybe we can offer them like insane, crazy discount taaki jo aapne initial apna enroll kiya hai ₹50-₹60 deke, jo bhi, toh that means you have shown your good intention ki haan, hum abhi se serious hain and we want... toh unke liye kuch crazy discount ho sakta hai. I was thinking on that perspective. Itne mein hi sir, woh filter out ho jaayega, right? Haan, kyunki dekho, koi bhi hoga jisko sirf time pass karna hai, woh email toh drop kar dega. But agar aap wahan pe ₹6, ₹10 bhi laga dete ho na ki woh UPI app open hogi, tab bhi log phir kehte hain, Nahi, nahi... Toh I think we should do something like this. At least... Let's ask the chat, kitna ticket price rakhna chahiye? 50, 60, 100, ya whatever. Poll karte hain, poll. I love polling. Ispe hota hai poll. Haan, main YouTube window bhi khol ke rakhta hoon. Accha, maine kabhi try hi nahi kiya. Filter out toh karna zaroori hai. Bina filter out kare toh... chaar option denge. Kaun Banega Crorepati ki tarah? Deviyon aur sajjano, aapke saamne hain chaar option. Fastest finger first. Oh nice. 500 is fair. Ankit bol rahe hain itna kyunki Ankit ka cohort ho chuka hai. Toh Ankit bol rahe... Arre Ankit sir apna woh bata rahe hain, return on first cohort. Oh nice. Abhiraj bol rahe hain, Hitesh, learning from Udemy course. Create content. Thanks, thanks, thanks. Aur upgrade kar rahe hain. Content pe hum bahut kaam kar rahe hain. ",
      "Dekho yaar, I personally think ek graduation degree aapke paas honi chahiye. Whatever is the bachelor degree. B.Com ho, BCA ho, B.Tech ho, I don't care about that. But ek proper, validatable, accreditable graduation degree zaroori hai. Yeh aapko aaj pay nahi karega. But honestly bataoon, kya hota hai? Kai baar aapko acche offers hain ya phir aap already kisi company mein kaam kar rahe ho. Aur tab aate hain compliances. Kyunki aisa nahi hai. Dekho, startup ke andar kisi ki bhi salary kuch bhi ho sakti hai. No problem at all. But aap jab compliance level ki company mein jaate ho, TCS, Infosys aur yeh sab, wahan par aapko ek level ke baad agar package chahiye na, you need to show the proof, not just your work, but aapko degree show karni padti hai. Aur India ke andar jaise Paytm ho gaya ya Phirpe ho gaya. Kyunki unpe koi bhi ek aarop laga sakta hai na, ki isko zyada paise kyun de rahe ho? Toh they need to provide a justification to the court and to wherever the filing is happening. Aur government bhi aapse yeh pooch sakti hai compliances ke baare mein. Shayad dekho, aap students ho, abhi college mein ho, aapko nahi pata ki yeh bhi kya word hota hai compliances. But compliances bahut badi cheez hai. Compliances ki vajah se aapki job jaa bhi sakti hai, jaati hui job bach bhi sakti hai, aapka packages badh bhi sakta hai aur badhta hua wapas bhi aa sakta hai. Sirf aapki skills maayne nahi rakhti. Compliances hoti hai. Toh kuch compliances aisi hoti hai, maan lijiye aap Capgemini mein kaam kar rahe hain, Accenture mein kaam kar rahe hain. Ab aapko on-site ka ek call hai ki you have to go to Australia for 3 months. Lekin Australian company kehti hai, Show us your graduation degree. Aur woh aapki graduation degree verify bhi karwayegi. Wahan pe agar aap... ho gaye, toh aapko woh on-site offer chhodna padega. Abhi mera ek friend hai, woh Sweden gaya hai. Kyunki uske paas masters degree thi. Woh kaam bhi accha karta hai, no doubt. But woh offer uske paas aaya tha kahin se reject hoke kyunki uske paas masters degree nahi thi. Sweden mein unhone kaha, We need somebody who has, who holds the masters degree. Toh jiske paas tha, woh accha developer tha. In fact, bahut accha tha, but uske paas sirf graduation degree thi. Uske paas naam ki masters degree thi. Toh woh six month ke liye Sweden gaya hai. Toh yahan pe jab aap atakte ho na, tab bahut bura lagta hai. Kyunki abhi nahi atakoge aap. Experience. Haan, yeh abhi kahin nahi atakoge initial days mein. Atakoge kab? 3 saal baad, 5 saal baad. Jab aap kahoge, Yaar, ab biwi-bacche vagera sab hai. Ab kahan se main degree karne jaaoon? Tab us din aapko hoga ki, Yaar, kar lena chahiye tha yaar. 2 saal zindagi kahan nikal gaye? Aur acchi, kyunki aapki degree na, verify hoti hai actually mein. Aur verification ke process hain, bahut, actually mein. Aapko bahut apne college se bhi bana ke rakhni padti hai ismein. Jaise agar aap US ki, Tech se kar rahe ho ya NYU se kar rahe ho, toh aapko apne college jaana padta hai. Your college will actually draft your, a degree and a copy of it, marksheets vagera. Uske upar ek woh, aah, seal lagate hain that cannot be broken aur woh unko wahan se degree send karni padti hai. Courier karna padta hai. Toh agar aapki college se acchi nahi banti hai, unhone rok diya toh aapka Caltech ya NYU mein admission tak ruk jaata hai. Toh again, yeh kisse kahani hai. Eventually, experience ke saath aapko pata lag jaati hai kyunki maine dekhe hain yeh sab hote hue. Mere friends ne liye hain admission Caltech mein, NYU mein. Abhi recently Sweden wala case hua. Woh bada khush tha ki, Sir, pata nahi kahan se meri toh jholi mein aake tapak gaya. Main chala Sweden. Toh kar lo bhai degree.",
      "Web cohort kab aayega? Please release it soon. December mein seats open hogi. Seats I think jaldi open kar denge. But, Jan... Jan.

Agar 6:00 p.m. se 2:00 a.m. hai toh, obvious si baat hai, live job karna bahut difficult rahega. Agar apni job ke beech mein ek ghanta nikaal ke, do, dedh ghanta nikaal ke join kar sakte ho, toh do it. Otherwise aap recordings dekh sakte ho. Recording phir aap chahe Python wala lo, chahe JavaScript wala lo, it's just means the same. I will not sugarcoat it. I will give you very honest opinion ki maza tabhi hai jab aap live mein aa jao.

Prateek sir actually mein na, thoda sa students ko bahut hi basic se leke ki, Nahi yaar, tumhein nahi aata. Chalo main ek-ek cheez batata hoon, ek-ek cheez batata hoon. Toh woh kabhi kabhar thoda, thoda sa slow pace rakhta hai. Teen-chaar class baad aapko uski aadat ho jaati hai aur woh thoda sa speed bhi badhate hain. But initial classes mein na, Prateek sir har student ko aise leke chalte hain, Nahi aata tumhein yaar, main batata hoon. Aur aap jitne doubt poochte ho na, woh chahe 2 ghante extra baithte hain but woh poore ek-ek doubt solve karke hi nikalte hain. That I would 100% say ki yaar Prateek sir goes really extra in that case. Toh definitely, I will say, proactive woh dheere-dheere hote hain. Toh just give them a little bit time. Woh ho jaayenge and work for it. But really happy that you will enjoy that and abhi bhi aap enjoy kar hi rahe ho. But definitely, dekho yeh kaam mat karna please. Ek yahan pe Raghuveer Singh keh rahe hain, Is it good idea to recite Python docs 100k times to memorize it? Really, really bad idea. Aisa idea aapko deta kaun hai? Pehli baat toh, aise mat karo. First year BCA, teaching experience, want to become teacher, help. Depend karta hai, agar tech mein kuch padhate hue, kuch aisa ho, toh you can ping me also. We can help you in hosting some of the sessions. Hamare student ke liye hum free kar denge. Aapko teaching, agar kuch padhane ka aisa mann hai, toh go ahead, work for it. Agar kuch tech hai, toh I am even ready to pay for you as well. Agar aap mein se bhi koi aisa teacher hai jo kuch padhana chahta hai, want to work with me or anything, ping me up. Nice. Context limit. Nice Aniruddh. I was about to ping you after this. So live stream ab end karte hain. I need to do some work jo main kaafi time se avoid kar raha tha. Ab mujhe kar lena chahiye. Theek hai? Okay. Bye bye everyone. Aaj ke liye itna hi karte hain. Thank you so much. Bye bye. ",

      "Project vs Product Mindset for new software engineers",

      "हां जी कैसे हैं आप सभी स्वागत है आप सभी का चाय और कोड में. हम बात करेंगे प्रोजेक्ट वर्सेस प्रोडक्ट अब आप कहेंगे सर हम भी प्रोडक्ट ही बनाना चाहते हैं प्रोजेक्ट क्यों बनाएंगे लेकिन एक बहुत बड़ा माइंडसेट का शिफ्ट है और ज्यादातर लोग ना प्रोजेक्ट ही बनाना चाहते हैं प्रोडक्ट नहीं बनाना चाहते गलतफहमी जरूर होती है कि हम प्रोडक्ट बनाना चाहते हैं लेकिन ज्यादातर लोग प्रोजेक्ट के पीछे ही जाते हैं प्रोडक्ट के पीछे एक माइंडसेट, तो शायद हम यह थोड़ा सा डिस्कशन करें तो हो सकता है हम भी अच्छे प्रोडक्ट की तरफ मूव ऑन कर लें तो आइए जी आपको एक छोटे से डिस्कशन पे लेके चलते हैं बात करते हैं",
      "हमारे “प्रोजेक्ट” वर्सेस “प्रोडक्ट” के ऊपर एक बहुत ही इंटरेस्टिंग चर्चा है। सबसे बड़ी बात ये है कि अगर आप हमारी ऑडियंस का बड़ा हिस्सा देखें जो प्रोग्रामिंग सीखता है — वे कंपेरेटिवली बहुत कम सीखते हैं। मुकाबले में, चार्टर्ड अकाउंटेंट, जर्नलिस्ट या मेडिकल साइंस पढ़ने वाले लोगों की बहुत बड़ी संख्या होती है, लेकिन हमारे इंडस्ट्री में जो लोग सच में प्रोग्रामिंग सीख रहे हैं, उनका सर्कल काफी छोटा है। अधिकांश लोग कॉलेज के चक्कर में उलझ जाते हैं — कॉलेज जो कहता है वही करते हैं: “पढ़ो, याद करो, एग्जाम में लिख दो”, और सोचते हैं यही पर्फेक्ट रास्ता है। लेकिन यह उनके साथ हुआ नहीं, यह डिजाइन की कमी है। यही वजह थी कि मैंने सोचा कि जो मैं सिखा रहा हूँ, वह real-world में कहीं काम आए — लेकिन यह बहुत कम हो पा रहा है। अब जो एक छोटा सा पोर्शन होता है — वह हिस्सा जहां लोग सच में प्रोग्रामिंग सीखते हैं, उसमें भी हमारे पास अलग-अलग सेगमेंट हैं। कुछ लोग कॉलेज कैम्पस पर निर्भर हैं या उन्हें बताया गया है कि DSA (डेटा स्ट्रक्चर एंड एल्गोरिदम) ही सब कुछ है। मैं इस बात से पूरी तरह फैलावर भी नहीं और डिनाई भी नहीं करता — DSA जरूरी है, क्योंकि यह एक अच्छा प्रोग्रामर बनाता है। लेकिन अगर इसे सिर्फ जॉब पाने के लिए पढ़ाएंगे और उसके बाद हाथ नहीं लगाएंगे, तो वह असली सीख नहीं।",
      "अब बात यह है कि Programming स्टार्ट कैसे करें? सबसे पहले हमने Foundation सीखना शुरू किया — चाहे कोई भी भाषा हो (C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP, Swift आदि) — जो भी language समझ में आई, उसे चुना और उसी से शुरुआत की। लेकिन foundation सीखते हुए आपको “under the sleeve” कुछ ऐसे trick मिलते हैं जो आपको बोल्ड बना सकते हैं, या फिर आप बीच में फंस सकते हैं।",
      "Implementation phase पर आकर अक्सर लोग फंस जाते हैं — वहां मैं हमेशा कहता हूँ “Copy Projects से शुरू करें।” जो YouTube पर ट्यूटोरियल में दिखते हैं — वह “Implementation पार्ट” का एक हिस्सा हैं और वास्तव में आपके लिए बहुत ज़रूरी हैं। पहले कंपनी या internship में senior developer के साथ काम करते हुए आप सीखते थे कि वह project कैसे बनता है, लेकिन आजकल यह teaching करने वाले बहुत कम रहते हैं।",
      "ये “Copy Projects” आपको वह एक्सपीरियंस देते हैं, जिसे पहले इंटर्नशिप में मिलता था — projects deliver होते हुए देखना। लेकिन अगर आप बार-बार वहीं कहीं अटके रहेंगे तो प्रॉब्लम उसी में है — न कि tutorials या tricks में।",
      "जब foundation हो गया, तो अगली स्टेप है Your Own Project या Your Own Product चुनना। पर इसमें सबसे important mindset shift आता है — कि आप project को कैसे एक Product Mindset के साथ लें",
      "पहला साइन है: Custom Domain होना — यह seriousness दिखाता है।",
      "दूसरा साइन: कोई Project Requirement Document (PRD) होना — क्या बना रहे हैं, किसके लिए बना रहे हैं यह define होना चाहिए।",
      "तीसरा साइन: Versioning — Version 1, Version 2 का Plan होना चाहिए।",
      "चौथा: Purpose beyond altruism — जब आप कुछ फ्री में देते हो तो responsibility कम रहती है, पर अगर आप कुछ शुल्क लेकर बनाओ तो आप ज्यादा deliverable बनने की जिम्मेदारी से जुड़े रहते हो।",
      "यह “How should I charge?” यह प्रश्न दरअसल सबसे अहम होता है और यह Project से Product में switch करने का सबसे बड़ा differentiation है। एक बार यह clear हो जाए कि आप पेमेंट कैसे लेंगे, तो Plan of Action कंपनी जैसे structured लगने लगते हैं।",
      "Product बनाते हुए याद रखना — पूरा कुछ नया out-of-the-box करने की ज़रूरत नहीं है। Postman जैसे products भी एक साधारण project से evolved हुए थे जिसको कोई एक starting point दिया। जब आपने इस mindset को समझ लिया, तो “Serving your paid users” सबसे ज़्यादा सीखने वाला अनुभव बन जाता है — क्योंकि paid environment में responsibility, tools, team, and accountability होते हैं।",
      "इसलिए मेरा मानना है: एक Project Mindset से Product Mindset की यात्रा समझनी चाहिए — लोग कॉलेज में रहते हुए या side projects में भी बड़े products बना चुके हैं, लेकिन हमें उस journey को समझने की ज़रूरत है ताकि हम पूरे engineering ecosystem को एक step आगे ले जाएं और मज़ा भी आए।",

      "Piyush sir, what do you think about the vibe coding? And if it is killing the logic of new developers? Yeh hua na accha question. Guys, this question needs attention. Dekho, main, I'll tell you one thing. Yeh jo IDEs aa chuke hain na, jo aapka yeh jo AI hai, jab tak yeh ChatGPT aur yeh web browser ke andar tha na, tab tak yeh theek tha. Ab yeh ghus chuka hai aapke coding editors ke andar. Theek hai? Aapke Cursor IDE ke andar, aapke VS Code ke andar. Now there is a problem. Developers ne sochna hi band kar diya hai. Toh there are two things. Jinke paas toh already experience hai, matlab ki jo pichle 5-6 saalon se ya usse zyada se coding kar rahe hain, jinke logics ban chuke hain, unke liye toh yaar dekho yeh typing speed bachata hai. Because technically, coding is 90% thinking and phir 10% coding. Toh unke liye toh yeh badhiya hai ki bhai maine kuch socha, maine prompt diya. Theek hai yaar, tu code kar de. Kaun jaake code karega? But new developers ne na isko thinking and coding, dono ke liye use karna shuru kar diya hai. Toh I think in the coming years, jo abhi freshers hain na, inka jo mindset hai woh utna grow nahi kar paayega. Eventually, jo log coding, matlab thinking mein acche honge na, woh ace kar jaayenge. Toh unke liye competition bahut kam hone wala hai. Sorry to say, I don't want to hurt anyone's feeling but that is true. Jitne bhi yeh freshers hain and you know, abhi college students hain, yeh sab AI ko use kar rahe hain in place of thinking, rather than coding. So haan, agar aap AI ko thinking mein use nahi kar rahe ho, aap khud se code kar rahe ho, aap khud se logic building kar rahe ho, toh congratulations. Aapke liye jo competition hai na, woh bahut kam hone wala hai.",
      "Vibe coding is a very bad thing for junior developers. Matlab main toh kahunga ki even ChatGPT ko bhi aap thoda kam use karo. Aur agar karna chahte ho na, uske saath brainstorm karo. Uske saath debate karo. Yaar main na yeh soch raha hoon banane ka aur meri yeh implementation hai. What do you think? Usse poocho pros and cons. Phir usse poocho, Accha, agar main aise implement karun toh sahi hai ya nahi? Aise poocho. Lekin aap kya karte ho Cursor mein? Yaar mujhe yeh karna hai, karke de de. Jo kar diya, done. Aise nahi hoti hai vibe coding. Woh, woh matlab next level vibe coding hai.",
      "Arre haan yaar, hum AI interview platform jab bana sakte hain, toh hum yeh bhi toh bana hi sakte hain na ki I am debating with AI. But tumhein pata hai AI ki problem kya hai? Woh na agree kar jaati hai hamesha. Matlab agar main usko bolunga, Yaar nahi, mere according yeh hona chahiye. Woh bolegi, Yes, you are correct. Problem yeh hai. Mujhe na thodi si phir unfiltered AI chahiye. Unfiltered samajhte ho na? Mujhe human-like AI chahiye ki agar main usko kuch bolun ki, Yaar, aise implement karenge, woh bolegi, Haan, theek hai. Agar tumne decide kar hi liya hai toh mujhse pooch kyun rahe ho? Usme ego issues hone chahiye. Toh pata lagega ki haan, asli senior developer se baat kar rahe hain. Aise kya hai? Main bol raha hoon, woh maan gayi. Na, na, usme nakhre add karne padenge. Ab mujhe nahi pata nakhre add karne ka system prompt kya hai. But you got the point.",
      "Okay, nice. First thing, if I am interviewing you, ya phir anyone, mainly main expect karunga ki kya aap edge cases soch sakte hain? Because that is where the experience comes. For example, agar hum kuch discuss kar rahe hain, theek hai? And aapko ek bahut hi simple sa task milta hai ki let's say we are building a chat application. Toh how will you scale it? Agar aap yahan par thoda distributed architecture ke baare mein bata sakte hain, right? Aap edge cases bata sakte hain ki yaar jab zyada users, jab zyada users aate hain toh aapko pata hai yeh ek problem aati hai, bottleneck aati hai. Rate limiting ki baat kar sakte ho. External API calls rate limiting ki baat kar sakte ho. Multiple queue systems ki baat kar sakte ho. Thoda sa database indexing ke baare mein baat kar rahe ho. Agar mujhe lag raha, agar kisi bhi interviewer ko lag raha hai ki yaar you are actually talking about production use cases, toh matlab ki aap experienced ho. Because technically, coding toh sabko aata hai. Coding toh yaar ek junior developer ko bhi aata hai. Coding senior developers ko bhi aata hai. But senior developers ne, matlab woh hai na, error khaake woh seekh gaye hain. Unhone itne errors face kar liye zindagi mein. Unko pata hai ki kahan par system phat sakta hai. Toh they know those edge cases aur unko pata hoga ki kaise isko pehle hi din se implement karna hai. Toh I think that's what makes you a senior developer just in case you are from the backend context. Toh yeh cheezein aapse expect ki jaayengi. Agar aap frontend ke andar ho toh same thing goes, right, ki agar aap user experience ke baare mein dhyan de pa rahe ho, because technically you know all the edge cases ki kahan par cheezein phat'ti hain.",
      "Sir, what tech stack will you recommend for MVP for a SaaS? Dekho, agar mujhe aaj ek MVP SaaS banana hoga, toh main choose karunga backend pe Node.js along with Fastify with TRPC.

And of course, Redis aur queue system ke liye I will always go with BullMQ Redis. And cloud ke liye I will always go with AWS. Storage waghera ke liye S3 use karunga main. Aur, aur, aur, and I will always containerize it. Theek hai? Main kabhi bhi serverless waghera side nahi jaunga. I will always choose containerization. Deployments ke liye it can be a Docker Compose deployment or it can, matlab haan, Docker Compose deployment is more than enough. API gateway ke liye aap Traefik use kar sakte ho.

      "सो ओपन एआई रिसेंटली लॉन्च देयर ओपन सोर्स मॉडल्स। सो इस वीडियो के अंदर बात करते हैं कि रिसेंटली GPT, जो कि ओपन एआई के मॉडल्स हैं, उन्होंने रिसेंटली अपने कुछ मॉडल्स को ओपन सोर्स कर दिया है। इस वीडियो के अंदर देखते हैं कि यह क्या है और यह बहुत ही एक रेवोल्यूशनरी चीज है। GPT, जो कि आपके ChatGPT को पावर करता है और AI के अंदर एक डोमिनेटिंग ट्रांसफॉर्मर इंजन है, उसका एक ओपन सोर्स वर्जन अब अवेलेबल है।",
      "आज के दिन GPT ने GPT OSS लॉन्च किया है। इसमें दो मॉडल्स हैं जो अब ओपन सोर्सली अवेलेबल हैं—GPT OSS 120 बिलियन पैरामीटर और GPT OSS 20 बिलियन। यह मॉडल्स ओपन वेट रीजनिंग मॉडल्स हैं और Hugging Face पर अवेलेबल हैं।",
      "GPT OSS 120B और GPT OSS 20B स्टेट-ऑफ-द-आर्ट ओपन वेट लैंग्वेज मॉडल्स हैं जो लो कॉस्ट पर स्ट्रॉन्ग रियल-वर्ल्ड परफॉर्मेंस डिलीवर करते हैं। इन्हें Apache लाइसेंस के तहत लॉन्च किया गया है, जिसका मतलब है कि कंपनियां इनका कोड देख सकती हैं, मॉडिफाई कर सकती हैं और डिप्लॉय भी कर सकती हैं। यह मॉडल्स सिमिलर साइज के दूसरे ओपन मॉडल्स को रीजनिंग टास्क में आउटपरफॉर्म करते हैं, स्ट्रॉन्ग टूल कैपेबिलिटीज दिखाते हैं और कंज्यूमर हार्डवेयर पर एफिशिएंट डिप्लॉयमेंट के लिए ऑप्टिमाइज्ड हैं।",
      "कोडिंग पर्सपेक्टिव से देखा जाए तो GPT OSS मॉडल्स का परफॉर्मेंस O3 और O4 मिनी रीजनिंग मॉडल्स के काफी करीब है, खासकर टूल्स के साथ। यह O4 मिनी जैसी एक्यूरेसी अचीव करता है, जो एक अच्छा बेंचमार्क है। कुछ बेंचमार्क्स में परफॉर्मेंस थोड़ी डाउन है, लेकिन कई जगह यह बेहतर भी है। सैम ऑल्टमैन ने भी ट्वीट किया है कि GPT OSS एक स्टेट-ऑफ-द-आर्ट ओपन वेट रीजनिंग मॉडल है जो O4 मिनी के कम्पेरेबल परफॉर्मेंस देता है।",
      "यह एक बड़ा कदम है क्योंकि अब यूज़र्स और कंपनियां इसे लोकली रन कर सकती हैं, चाहे कंप्यूटर हो या फोन। 120 बिलियन पैरामीटर वर्जन प्रोडक्शन और हाई रीजनिंग के लिए है, जबकि 20 बिलियन पैरामीटर वर्जन लो लेटेंसी और लोकल डिप्लॉयमेंट के लिए बेहतर है।",
      "यूज़ करने के लिए, आपको transformers इंस्टॉल करना होगा (pip install transformers), फिर टेक्स्ट जनरेशन पाइपलाइन बनानी होगी और मॉडल आईडी यूज़ करनी होगी। यह ChatML फॉर्मेट सपोर्ट करता है। डॉक्यूमेंटेशन और कोड Hugging Face पर अवेलेबल है, और दोनों GPT OSS मॉडल्स को स्पेशल टास्क के लिए फाइन-ट्यून किया जा सकता है।",
      "इस ओपन सोर्स रिलीज़ से फाइन-ट्यून वर्जन का फ्लड आ सकता है क्योंकि बहुत सी कंपनियां और डेवलपर्स इसे अपनाएंगे। यह वाकई AI वर्ल्ड में एक गेम-चेंजिंग स्टेप है।",
